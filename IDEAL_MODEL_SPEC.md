# HYPER-TENSOR PROTOCOL (HTP): Core Protocol Specification

"The Soul evolves, the Will optimizes, the Body manifests."

## Abstract

This document defines the Hyper-Tensor Protocol (HTP). The protocol establishes an algebraic evolution mechanism based on the Ideal Class Group of Imaginary Quadratic Fields for the generation, verification, and materialization of logical paths.

**Core Transformation:**
The system evolves from a "matrix-based logic verifier" to a "group theory-based logic generator." Truth is no longer a static constraint, but a natural manifestation of algebraic structures at their minimum energy state.

## 1. The Soul: Algebraic State Space

### 1.1 The Manifold: Class Group $Cl(\Delta)$
The core state space of the system is defined as the Class Group $Cl(\Delta)$ of the imaginary quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta})$.

* **Discriminant:** $\Delta < 0$ and $\Delta \equiv 0, 1 \pmod 4$.
* **Group Elements:** Represented by binary quadratic forms $f(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, denoted as the triplet $(a, b, c)$.
* **Group Operation:** Gauss Composition, denoted as $\circ$.

$$S_{new} = S_{current} \circ S_{delta}$$

### 1.2 The Seed of Evolution
The starting point of logic generation is the hash mapping of the context. We define a deterministic mapping $\mathcal{H}: \mathcal{T}^* \to Cl(\Delta)$, which transforms any text context into initial algebraic kinetic energy.

$$S_0 = S_{identity} \circ \mathcal{H}(\text{Context})$$

This implies that the same context will always produce the same initial "Soul" state.

### 1.3 State Evolution Dynamics
Temporal evolution is no longer linear matrix multiplication, but chaotic iteration on group orbits.

$$S_{t+1} = S_t^2 \circ \epsilon_t$$

* **Spin (Squaring):** $S_t^2$ provides the primary dynamical propulsion, not only altering the state but also increasing algebraic complexity.
* **Perturbation:** $\epsilon_t \in Cl(\Delta)$ is the control term applied by the Will (VAPO).

## 2. The Will: Valuation-Adaptive Control

### 2.1 The Optimization Objective
The responsibility of the Will is to find an optimal algebraic state $S^*$ such that its materialized logical path satisfies the zero-energy constraint of the STP (Symmetry/Structure Transformation Protocol).

$$\text{Minimize } E_{STP}(\Psi(S)) \quad \text{subject to } S \in Cl(\Delta)$$

Where $\Psi$ is the Materialization Map.

### 2.2 Perturbation Algebra
Control is no longer an additive bias ($\vec{b}$), but a multiplicative perturbation ($\epsilon$). The VAPO algorithm searches within the algebraic neighborhood centered at $S_{current}$.

Neighborhoods are defined by the $p$-adic norm. We generate a series of infinitesimal group elements $\{\pi_p\}$ with different norms (prime $p$).

* **Coarse Search:** Using $\pi_p$ generated by large-norm primes (Large $p$). This corresponds to Tunneling (long-distance jumps) within the Class Group graph.
* **Fine Search:** Using $\pi_p$ generated by small-norm primes (Small $p$). This corresponds to local fine-tuning (Gradient-like Descent).

$$S_{next} = S_{current} \circ \pi_p^{\pm 1}$$

### 2.3 The VAPO Algorithm
1.  **Propose:** Select a perturbation set $\{\pi_p\}$ according to the current "temperature" (Valuation Schedule).
2.  **Evolve:** Parallelly compute candidate states $S'_i = S \circ \pi_i$.
3.  **Evaluate:** Calculate the energy $E_i = E_{STP}(\Psi(S'_i))$.
4.  **Select:** Greedily select the state with $E_{min}$, or accept an inferior solution based on the Metropolis criterion to escape local minima.

## 3. The Body: Topological Materialization

### 3.1 The Projection Map $\Psi$
To allow the abstract algebraic state $(a, b, c)$ to interact with real-world logical symbols, a non-linear projection process is required.

**Artin-like Projection:**
We map group elements onto the finite field $\mathbb{Z}_p$ to generate discrete Tokens or Action IDs.

$$\Psi(S) = [ \text{Hash}(S) \pmod {P_1}, \text{Hash}(S^2) \pmod {P_2}, \dots ]$$

This projection ensures that states close in algebraic space maintain a degree of similarity in logical space (e.g., belonging to the same class of operations), while introducing necessary discretization barriers.

### 3.2 Semantic Adapter
The final layer of the Body is an adapter that converts numerical sequences into ProofAction.

* **Layer 0 (Routing):** The first digit determines the action type (Define, Apply, Assert).
* **Layer 1 (Parameterization):** Subsequent digits determine action parameters (Symbol ID, Theorem ID).

This process is a deterministic one-way function.

## 4. Security & Verifiability

### 4.1 Time Security (Hidden Order)
The security of the system relies on the Discrete Logarithm (DL) Problem in Class Groups.

If an attacker wishes to forge a state $S_{fake}$ to make it appear as if it evolved from $S_0$, they must find a $k$ such that $S_0^k = S_{fake}$. Given an unknown class number $h(\Delta)$, this is computationally infeasible.

This guarantees the causal uniqueness of logic generation: any generated logical path is not only "correct" but also "uniquely" belonging to the evolutionary history of that specific context.

### 4.2 Proof of Will
The final product generated by the Evolver is not just a logical path, but a Proof Bundle:

$$\text{Bundle} = \{ \text{ContextHash}, S_{final}, \text{Trace}_{\epsilon} \}$$

* **ContextHash:** Locks the problem.
* **S_{final}:** Locks the result.
* **Trace_{\epsilon}:** Locks the optimization process (proving that the Will indeed performed "work").

The Verifier can replay the $\text{Trace}_{\epsilon}$ to validate the legitimacy of $S_{final}$, thereby achieving Proof of Optimization Work.

## 5. Conclusion
HTP defines a self-contained generative system.

* Logic is the low-energy state of the Algebra.
* Search is the navigation through the Group Manifold.
* Output is the projection of the Soul.

This is the path to Native Algebraic Intelligence.
