## 1. Overview

The Unified Energy Metric $J(S)$ measures the "Cognitive Dissonance" of a state $S$ in the Quaternion Algebra.

---

## 2. The Objective Function Components

The total Hamiltonian $J$ is composed of three distinct forces:

### 2.1 The Semantic Objective ($E_{obj}$)

Represents the geometric goal.

$$E_{obj}(S) = || \Psi_{topo}(S) - \Psi_{target} ||^2$$

In v1.0, $\Psi_{topo}$ maps the Quaternion state to the Modular Form Feature Space.

### 2.2 The Axiomatic Residuals ($C(S)$)

$$C_{stp}(S) = || L(S) - R(S) ||^2$$

(Algebraic difference between Left and Right sides of STP equations).

### 2.3 The Logical Slack ($\xi$)

A vector variable managed by the optimizer to handle paradoxes.

## 3. Energy Levels

| Hamiltonian Value $J$ | System State | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\approx 0.0$ | **Nirvana** | Perfect Logic. All axioms satisfied. |
| Low ($< 10.0$) | **Compromise** | Logically valid, or minimal violation. |
| High ($> 100.0$) | **Dissonance** | Structural conflict. Logic is broken. |
